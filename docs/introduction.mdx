# Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to explore this project.

**Note: This site documents the 0.x versions of remirror. For the current documentation please visit <https://remirror.io>.**

At the moment the focus is on releasing a stable API and while this is ongoing documentation has slipped from
being the priority.

Right now the best way to understand the library is to read through the codebase and take a look at how
existing editors have been structured. A quick way to get started is to
[spin up our Next.js example](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/blob/master/examples/with-next/readme.md#getting-started).
